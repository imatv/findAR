###"Oh, there you AR."

findAR is an Oculus Rift augmented reality application that allows users to view their world
in various filter settings such as grayscale, sepia, black/white, outlines, and hue gradient.
It also has a color picker mode that detects a lost object's color and desaturates the background,
allowing users to locate lost objects of certain colors. Facial and object detection/recognition
features were added as well.
